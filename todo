BUGS

Client deletes pair0.dat upon exit.

REOPENED - same crash happens when client is not supplied with prefs for a while
RESOLVED - had to do with TAU allocation in ENVS constructor
Client complains something about glibc memory allocation and exits if you're not gentle with it.

RESOLVED - server did not reset its preference table properly before scanning preference files
All pairs supplied by server, starting with the 2nd, are the same. Same pairs are supplied 
to different clients when there are several clients.

RESOLVED - client deleted pair0.dat upon start
Client does not find pair0.dat file if was in the SavedFiles/ before client process start.
