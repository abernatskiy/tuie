1. \Theta trick for checking the properties of bcppg
2. The n lg n Matrix optimization
3. Examine bcppg directly
4. Show that method converges correctly for approximate users
5. (IMPORTANT) Add novely to pair generation algorithm

BUGS

RESOLVED - its actually a feature
005 Client deletes pair0.dat upon exit.

RESOLVED - likely the same mechanism as in bug 003 + some memory leaks were at work. Solved.
004 Random server segfaults.

RESOLVED - the likely cause of the problem found - client opened pair files before they were fully written by server. Solved.
REOPENED - same crash happens when client is not supplied with prefs for a while
RESOLVED - had to do with TAU allocation in ENVS constructor
003 Client complains something about glibc memory allocation and exits if you're not gentle with it.

RESOLVED - server did not reset its preference table properly before scanning preference files
002 All pairs supplied by server, starting with the 2nd, are the same. Same pairs are supplied 
to different clients when there are several clients.

RESOLVED - client deleted pair0.dat upon start
001 Client does not find pair0.dat file if was in the SavedFiles/ before client process start.
