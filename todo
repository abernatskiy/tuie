-10!. Examine bcppg directly
-1. Ambiguity reductor optimization - ambiguities tend to occur at the edges of the interval, which allows for some optimization 
1. \Theta trick for checking the properties of bcppg
4. Show that method converges correctly for approximate users
5. (IMPORTANT) Add novely to pair generation algorithm

INVESTIGATIONS

Why do two individual TAUs always pick the same controller as their 3rd?

(CLOSED) Output learning gaps - are due to user indicating a new preference. For one run number of generations between surrogate user 
preference indications was measured and turned out to be 8.51 on average with stddev of 0.82.

BUGS

008 Conflicts happen spontaneously in rankings.

006 Client-server pair sometimes hangs - something writes tmp0.. file (with a pair-like 
contents), then no deployment happens. Evolution continues, and if you erase this file, 
it reappears. The fun part is that the pairs are deployed just fine after I kill clients.

RESOLVED - no check for the matrix fullness was applied in TAU::Store_Pref()'s n log n code
007 Sometimes TAU merger reports two controllers with the same score in one of TAUs. This 
is not an expected behaviour.

RESOLVED - its actually a feature
005 Client deletes pair0.dat upon exit.

RESOLVED - likely the same mechanism as in bug 003 + some memory leaks were at work. Solved.
004 Random server segfaults.

RESOLVED - the likely cause of the problem found - client opened pair files before they were fully written by server. Solved.
REOPENED - same crash happens when client is not supplied with prefs for a while
RESOLVED - had to do with TAU allocation in ENVS constructor
003 Client complains something about glibc memory allocation and exits if you're not gentle with it.

RESOLVED - server did not reset its preference table properly before scanning preference files
002 All pairs supplied by server, starting with the 2nd, are the same. Same pairs are supplied 
to different clients when there are several clients.

RESOLVED - client deleted pair0.dat upon start
001 Client does not find pair0.dat file if was in the SavedFiles/ before client process start.
